        </h1>
        <p>
            Ayro is dependant of if you have No KB plugged in OR that you have a controller

            How does it chooses your target?
        </h2>
        <p>
            As explained in the "How to Install" segment, you have the RANGE and Target mode options
            and it chooses via your target mode and it's configs and then will do a loop between all targets in certains folders (thanks to inside the code you have ListTarget thats a table btw)
